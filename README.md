Perfect for work, school or in the kitchen.

Available unit conversions include:
- Temperature (celsius, fahrenheit, kelvin, etc)

**TIPS**
- Use the slide-in menu for navigation between conversions and select the units you require. To open the slide-in menu, swipe in from the left edge of the app, or press the app icon in the top left corner.
